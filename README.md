The following is the output of the linear regression used to predict the MPG:

The slope of the linear model is not zero. The null hypothesis is rejected because our p-value is considerably lower than our significance level.

As for the variables, the ground clearance and vehicle length are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance. This means that these two have a considerable effect on the MPG.
